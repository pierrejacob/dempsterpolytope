# dempsterpolytope

This package implements a Gibbs sampler to perform inference a la Dempster
1966's "New Methods for Reasoning Towards Posterior Distributions Based on
Sample Data" (see https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoms/1177699517)

This is about the classical problem of estimating the parameters of a
Categorical distributions based on observed counts. This package reproduces the
results of a technical report by Pierre E. Jacob, Arthur P. Dempster, Paul T.
Edlefsen, Ruobin Gong. The code has not been thoroughly tested.
